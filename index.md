## Pet Projects
**[2022] Finding memes by string. Telegram bot**  
_On the fritz now_  

`imagehash` - for image (memes) deduplication; hash type and hash size was selected experimentally  
`Tesseract` - for text recognition (on multiple languages simultaneously)

TBD

**[2022] Order readiness notification. Telegram bot**  
_Works now_ <br>

Bot for bar Zionist (Moscow) was developed to cover the issue of ppl not knowing when to pick up the food from the counter (foodcourt system). The path was: clients order the food at the counter and after some time should have come to pick it up. Normally clients could make this route several times till the food was ready. The co-owner of this bar is my friend, that's why there was no problem with launching the bot.

Actually, 2 bots: for guests and chefs. 2 bots share the same database: `JSON-file` ðŸ™‚ This file contains orders and telegram ids to send notifications. Why JSON-file - because it is simple and the bot usage number is from 10 to 100 times a day. 
Guest sends the order number in the bot -> chef press the button on a special keyboard with order numbers when it's ready -> guest gets a notification with the "bon appetit" in different languages.

It's a straightforward and simple solution, really useful for me, my friends and other bar guests.

**[2022] Site parsing by specified parameters. Telegram bot**   
_Out of date_ <br>

Bot sends search results every weekday: a message with statistics (number of the search results) on results + an excel table with actual results.

The finite state machine was implemented to set the source data for search. 
The subscription option was implemented after the test period. one of the payment services supported by Telegram (yookassa) was used for subscription payments. 

Base libraries: `aiogram`, `beautifulsoup`. DB: `SQLite3`. Most of code with `type hinting`. Development and deployment using `Docker`. `Makefile` to run frequent commands: tests, linters (flake8, mypy), formatter (black), rebuilding and entering into the container. For each test clean DB is created. DB with all actual migrations and filling with data for each test individually if necessary. `Crons`: site parsing + saving results in DB; saving results from DB into excel tables; messages formation and sending the results.

Bot was deployed on `DigitalOcean` and worked for a 3 weeks for 5 familiar users, but nowadays it has lost relevance.

**[2020] Pet projects for inner usage of QuantorForm**  
_Working now_
 <br>
1. Service for generation of mechanical properties (flow stress) of steel by chemical composition (an original approach to the problem).  
Formulation of an idea -> formalization of a task -> data collection -> data processing -> training of a regression model (Catboost) -> development of a service on Flask (drawing graphs small amount of JS)

2. Search service for materials by name and chemical composition.  
Has written search algorithm taking into account the specifics of the name of the materials for various standards.
