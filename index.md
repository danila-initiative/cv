## Pet Projects
**[2022] Finding memes by string. Telegram bot**  
_On the fritz now_  

This bot helped users to search images (memes) by entering keywords.  
Stack:  
`imagehash` - for images (memes) deduplication; hash type and hash size was selected experimentally;  
`Tesseract` - for text recognition (multiple languages simultaneously);  
`elasticsearch` - is a search engine and DB. DB contains image hashes, recognized and processed text

MVP: telegram bot (hosted locally) and static DB (13 000 memes). The operability has been checked on my friends.

I've decided then to change the project architecture; to make the bot work perfectly; to add automatic continuous enrichment of the memes DB. The project is on hold now =()

**[2022] Order readiness notification. Telegram bot**  
_Works now_ <br>

Bot for bar Zionist (Moscow) was developed to cover the issue of ppl not knowing when to pick up the food from the counter (foodcourt system). The path was: clients order the food at the counter and after some time should come to pick it up. Normally clients could make this route several times till the food was ready. It was easy to launch this bot cause the co-owner of this bar is my friend.

2 bots, actually: for guests and chefs. 2 bots share the same database: `JSON-file` ðŸ™‚ This file contains orders and telegram ids to send notifications. Why JSON-file - because it's simple and the bot usage number is from 10 to 100 times a day. 
Guest sends the order number in the bot -> chef presses the button on a special keyboard with order numbers when it's ready -> guest gets a notification with the "bon appetit" in different languages.

It's a straightforward and simple solution, really useful for me, my friends and other bar guests.

**[2022] Site parsing by specified parameters. Telegram bot**   
_Out of date_ <br>

Bot sends search results every weekday: a message with statistics of results (number of the search results) + an excel table with actual results.

The finite state machine was implemented to set the source data for search. 
The subscription option was implemented after the test period. One of the payment services supported by Telegram (yookassa) was used for subscription payments. 

Base libraries: `aiogram`, `beautifulsoup`. DB: `SQLite3`. Most of the code with `type hinting`. Development and deployment using `Docker`. `Makefile` to run frequent commands: tests, linters (flake8, mypy), formatter (black), rebuilding and entering into the container. Clean DB is created for each test: DB with all actual migrations and filling with data for each test individually if necessary. `Crons`: site parsing + saving results in DB; saving results from DB into excel tables; messages formation and sending the results.

The bot was deployed on `DigitalOcean` and worked for 3 weeks for 5 familiar users, but nowadays it has lost relevance.

**[2020] Pet projects for inner usage of QuantorForm**  
_Works now_
 <br>
1. Service for mechanical properties (flow stress) of steel generation. Flow stress generates by steel chemical composition (an original approach to the problem).  
Formulation of an idea -> formalization of a task -> data collection -> data processing -> training of a regression model (Catboost) -> development of a service on Flask (drawing graphs with a small amount of JS) -> result (excel tables with graphs). Two plants use models that were generated for them on a daily basis. 

2. Search service for materials by name and chemical composition.
Search algorithm was written taking into account the specifics of the name of the materials for various standards. This part mostly helped technical support department to resolve customer requests.
