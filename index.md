## Additional
**Telegram bot for site parsing by specified parameters (2022)** <br>
Bot sends search results every weekday: a message with statistics on results + excel table with results.

Was implemented finite state machine to set the source data for search. 
The possibility of paying for a subscription after the test period was implemented. For payments was using one of payment acceptance service supported by the Telegram (yookassa). 

Base libraries: aiogram, beautifulsoup. DB: SQLite3. Most of code with type hinting. Development and deployment using Docker. Makefile to run frequent commands: tests, linters (flake8, mypy), formatter (black), rebuilding and entering into the container. For each test clean DB is created. DB with all actual migrations and filling with data for each test individually if necessary. Crons: site parsing + saving results in DB; saving results from DB into excel tables; messages formation and sending the results.


**Pet projects for inner usage of QuantorForm (2020)** <br>
1. Service for generation of mechanical properties (flow stress) of steel by chemical composition (an original approach to the problem).  
Formulation of an idea -> formalization of a task -> data collection -> data processing -> training of a regression model (Catboost) -> development of a service on Flask (drawing graphs small amount of JS)

2. Search service for materials by name and chemical composition.  
Has written search algorithm taking into account the specifics of the name of the materials for various standards.
